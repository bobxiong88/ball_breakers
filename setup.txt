These are the setup instructions for the game! Please read these very carefully before starting development!

Note: You MUST use windows for this project as that is going to be the only operating system this game will be compatible with!

First, insure you have the following programs installed:
- Devc++
- Github desktop

Now follow these steps:
- Open github desktop
- Setup a workspace for your copy of the project on your desktop, for example, I use (C:\projects\ball_breakers)
- Try not to include spaces in your workspace directory or you might screw some things up
- Now that you have your workspace, with the GUI of github desktop clone this game's repository onto the workspace of your local computer
- Now click the dropdown menu on the top of the window called "branches" and select "develop"
- Next you must copy the current contents of the program onto your workspace, to do so, click the large "fetch" button on the top-right of
  your github for desktop window
- Wait as github copies the files onto your computer.
- Congratulations, you now have all the cpp and header files on your computer! Next we must setup our IDE

Setting up Devc++:
- Open Devc++
- Create a new project and choose "empty project" as the project type, name it anything you want but it is suggested to use ball_breakers
  unless you know what your doing
- Now right click on your project, and press "add file"
- A window will pop up, select "main.cpp"
- You now have the main cpp file on your computer
- Now repeat and add all the cpp and header(.h) files to your local project
- Delete the default file in your project called "untitled1" or similar
- Click on the main.cpp file and click compile on the top menu of devc++
- If the project compiles, congratulations! You have setup the working environment and can begin coding!
